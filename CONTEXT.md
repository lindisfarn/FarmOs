# Lindisfarn Operational Bible: Broiler SOP (DRAFT)

This document synthesizes the operational wisdom of the Lindisfarn course transcripts, organized into a cohesive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for high-performance pastured poultry.

## 0. Core Philosophy
*   **The "NASCAR" Bird:** Cornish Cross are high-performance athletes. They require "high-octane" care, precise environments, and "detoxifying" chlorophyll to reach their genetic potential without breakdown.
*   **Time Compression:** 1 day for a chick = ~4 months for a human. A 4-hour mistake (cold/thirst) is a permanent developmental stunt.
*   **Nature's Detox:** Grass (chlorophyll) is the biological filter that allows these birds to thrive outdoors.

## Phase 1: Brooding (Weeks 0–3)

### 1.1 Infrastructure & Vermin Defense
*   **Flooring:** **Concrete only.** Concrete sills and floors are the only definitive defense against rats.
*   **Walls:** Do not insulate. Rats nest in insulation. It is cheaper to heat the air than to feed the rats with chick lives.
*   **Ventilation:** High-level air flow (cupolas/vents) without floor-level drafts.

### 1.2 The "Carbonaceous Diaper" (Bedding)
*   **Material:** **Wood Shavings** (curly/fluffy). Avoid sawdust (packs down) and straw (mats).
*   **Deep Bedding:** Maintain up to 24 inches of "working compost." The microbial activity creates a "good bugs beat bad bugs" environment.
*   **The Sandwich Test:** If the air is too ammonia-heavy for you to enjoy a sandwich, add more carbon (shavings).

### 1.3 Receiving & The "Grit Mandate"
*   **Placement:** 90°F target. Check birds within **1 hour** of arrival.
*   **The Grit Charge:** Gizzards must be "charged" within 72 hours.
    *   *Protocol:* Place feed in shallow trays. Cover feed completely with a layer of **Starter Grit**. Chicks must eat through the rocks to get to the grain.
*   **Thermal Checks:**
    *   *Perfect:* A "donut" of birds around the heat source.
    *   *Too Cold:* Piling/clumping in the center (suffocation risk).
    *   *Too Hot:* Birds pushed to the perimeter.

## Phase 2: Pasture (Weeks 3–8)

### 2.1 The Transition
*   **Age:** 2-3 weeks (minimum). Birds must be heavy enough to push through grass without getting "tangled."
*   **Timing:** **Morning move only.** Never move birds to the field during a cold rain or in the evening.
*   **Thermal Mass:** Target **75 birds per shelter**. Fewer than 50 leads to hypothermia; more than 100 leads to piling/suffocation.

### 2.2 Chore Choreography (The "Morning Sprint")
*   **Orientation:** Open-end faces **East** (birds move toward morning light).
*   **The "Jerky Move":** Move the shelter 1-2 feet at a time using the Dolly. Let birds catch up; never "bulldoze" them.
*   **The Salad Bar Strategy:**
    1.  Move all shelters first (break ground contact).
    2.  Water all shelters.
    3.  **Wait 40 minutes** before adding feed. This forces ingestion of dewy, fresh grass ("Ice Cream") before grain gorging.

### 2.3 Pasture Management
*   **The "Ice Cream" Rule:** Grass should be **1 to 4 inches**. If it's longer, mow or graze with cows first. Long grass causes "poop-tops" (manure matting) and hides predators.
*   **Water Hygiene:** Use the **Two-Bucket System**. White (Carry) bucket goes to shelters; Blue (Dip) bucket stays at the tank. Never touch the dip bucket to the ground.

### 2.4 Health & Mortality
*   **Heart Attacks ("Flip-overs"):** If birds are dying on their backs with legs out, growth is outpacing organs. **Solution:** Limit feed. Pull feed at 3 PM and return in the AM for 4-7 days.
*   **Benchmarks:** Plan for 2-4% loss in brooder, 3-5% in field (5-9% total).

### 2.5 Predator Defense (Layered)
*   **Visual Identification:**
    *   *Fox:* Missing birds (off-site).
    *   *Raccoon:* Heads missing.
    *   *Mink/Weasel:* "Vampire" neck punctures; high mortality.
*   **Defense:** Enclosed shelters, short grass (no cover), and **8,000V electricity** on the metal siding if bears or persistent predators occur.

## Phase 3: Harvest & Processing

### 3.1 Pre-Harvest Protocol
*   **Fasting:** Remove feed **18 hours** before processing (Noon for 8 AM start). **Keep water available** to ensure easy evisceration.
*   **The Pre-Catch Move:** Move the shelter 5 minutes before catching to ensure clean feet/legs.

### 3.2 Catching Technique
*   **Tool:** Two plywood paddles (8ft and 4ft).
*   **Process:** Remove door -> Use 8ft paddle to crowd -> Use 4ft paddle to secure -> Pick up by "the handles" (legs). No chasing.
*   **Crates:** Standard poultry crates. Pack snugly; the "hug" calms the birds.

### 3.3 Processing Benchmarks
*   **Labor Efficiency:** 20 birds per person-hour.
*   **Evisceration:** 30 seconds per bird.
*   **Chill:** 24-hour post-mortem chill is mandatory to prevent muscle toughness.

## 4. Economics & Ontario Benchmarks

### 4.1 CFO Small Batch Program (Ontario)
*   **Quota Limit:** Up to **2,000 birds/year** under the Small Batch program.
*   **Target Market:** High-end, relationship-based direct sales.

### 4.2 Financial Cross-Reference
| Metric | Polyface Benchmark | Ontario Organic Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Retail Price** | $4.00 / lb | **$7.00 / lb** |
| **Gross Rev (4.5lb bird)** | $18.00 | **$31.50** |
| **Feed Cost** | $4.20 (Non-GMO) | **$8.00 - $10.00 (Organic)** |
| **Total Expense** | ~$8.30 | **~$14.00 - $16.00** |
| **Net Margin** | ~$9.70 | **~$15.00 - $17.50** |

### 4.3 Key Benchmarks for Success
*   **Land Use:** 500 birds per acre per year.
*   **Infrastructure Payback:** Gross income from Year 1 should pay for all shelters/brooders ($1.25 capital cost/bird).
*   **The Fertility Exchange:** Use the ~200 lbs of Nitrogen per move to negotiate "free rent" on neighbor's land in exchange for soil healing.
